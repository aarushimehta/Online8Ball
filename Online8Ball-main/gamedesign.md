Story: 8ball
characters: PC - 8ball stick; NPC - balls
goal: get all your balls in the pocket(before your opponent)
rules: aim the white ball towards other balls and try to get them in the pocket. If you get the black 8 ball in the pocket before all your other balls are in, you lose the game. (If the white ball gets in the pocket the other player can place it wherever they want and aim). Pull the stick to launch pressure from it so that the white ball can move.
balance: Depends on player.
adaptivity: The game gets harder on its own, the balls spread out and they are in random spots so that makes it harder for the player to aim accurately.
feedback: if ball gets in pocket, it plays a sound. The feedback displays on its own, basically on how many balls are left in the pool table.
